# from trumpinsane to insane: a coin swap #

Insane is independent of trump. It is a new compile, with a different genesis block, merkel hash root, nonce, unix start time, ports, pchMessages, base58 address which begins with the letter "i" for insane. It is a new chain and can not intermingle with its predecessor. It retains similar characteristics (see below). One difference is to allow mining up to 14,000 blocks, to give an opportunity for people to mine it.

# Destroying Returned Trumpinsane #

<p>After a claim has been settled the Trumpinsane should be destroyed. An address was made for this purpose. It was made using a Python Base58 and Base58Check implementation template. No private key was generated and the coins do not stake, nor can they be removed by anyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://109.169.57.125:3001/address/TBurntrumpinsaneCoinSwapDeadZMtQWg" target="_blank">TBurntrumpinsaneCoinSwapDeadZMtQWg</a></p>

<p>Broken down: "T Burn trumpinsane CoinSwap Dead ZMtQWg." </p>

<p>The last six characters, ZMtQWg, act as a checksum, and are generated using the Python Base58 and Base58Check implementation template along with the first 28 chosen characters.</p>

# An extra 7.5 million insane #

<p>There is circa 7.5 million insane to decide about what to do with. This is the money left over after all swaps have been undertaken. Under Trumpinsane the same amount had been set aside for bounties, faucets, dice, wed design, etc. This account does not stake.</p>
