# from trumpinsane to insane: a coin swap #

Insane is independent of trump. It is a new compile, with a different genesis block, merkel hash root, nonce, unix start time, ports, pchMessages, base58 address which begins with the letter "i" for insane. It is a new chain and can not intermingle with its predecessor. It retains similar characteristics (see below). One difference is to allow mining up to 14,000 blocks, to give an opportunity for people to mine it.

# Destroying Returned Trumpinsane #


<p>Trumpinsane coins sent to be swapped for insane coins ahould not be left lying around in 1 account address, <a href="http://109.169.57.125:3001/address/TQoEjW3d8WQhCmvTgbMj1fRqdrVsRLEqyS" target="_blank">TBurntrumpinsaneCoinSwapDeadZMtQWg</a>, especially so if these coins are then staked causing network instability and slow-down. In addition, it is a security risk as they could be stolen or used by the account holder to claim free insane.</p>

<p>After a claim has been settled the Trumpinsane should be destroyed. An address was made for this purpose. It was made using a Python Base58 and Base58Check implementation template. No private key was generated and the coins do not stake, nor can they be removed by anyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://109.169.57.125:3001/address/TBurntrumpinsaneCoinSwapDeadZMtQWg" target="_blank">TBurntrumpinsaneCoinSwapDeadZMtQWg</a></p>

<p>Broken down: "T Burn trumpinsane CoinSwap Dead ZMtQWg." </p>

<p>The last six characters, ZMtQWg, act as a checksum, and are generated using the Python Base58 and Base58Check implementation template along with the first 28 chosen characters.</p>

# Destroying a Trumpinsane Bounty Pot #

<p>The Bounty Pot which was sent by me to <a href="http://109.169.57.125:3001/address/THNHFC6SxHw6ngjcmBNxCy4an2P7D4hXEj" target="_blank">THNHFC6SxHw6ngjcmBNxCy4an2P7D4hXEj</a> serves no purpose now, and it is not one persons property. It should also be destroyed for security reasons, or the risk of it being used to claim free insane. Again it should be sent here:</p>

<p><a href="http://109.169.57.125:3001/address/TBurntrumpinsaneCoinSwapDeadZMtQWg" target="_blank">TBurntrumpinsaneCoinSwapDeadZMtQWg</a></p>

<p>at the moment 1 person has at least 16 million of 21 million Trumpinsane, and more than half of those are being staked. The network is slowing down considerably due to that.</p>

# An extra 7.5 million insane #

<p>There is circa 7.5 million insane to decide about what to do with. This is the money left over after all swaps have been undertaken. Under Trumpinsane 6.5 million had stood unused in 1 account. It seems that a different more adventerous strategy should be decided by all stakeholders on what to with that extra insane. It is NOT, the property of any single individual. If it disappears into different accounts it has been taken. </p>
